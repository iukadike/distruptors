### Problem

Many Nigerians are tenants rather than landlords. When they choose to become landlords, acquiring a land is usually tough especially in hotspot areas, not to mention building a structure on the land. Usually such person resorts to very remote areas to acquire land with the hope that such area will develop in the near future.

### Proposed Solution

Creating affordable housing for people to own instead of renting. Demystifying ownership of houses by individuals and no more renting norm that people are used to.Thereby ,easing the problem of overpopulation and congestion in the urban cities.

### Proposed Stack

Laravel, HTML, CSS, mysql, Bootstrap
